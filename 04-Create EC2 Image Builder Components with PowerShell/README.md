## Learning Objectives

* Components are one of the fundamental building blocks of EC2 Image Builder
* First thing we need to do is [create a component](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/image-builder-application-documents.html) in YAML syntax
* Let's search for commands that are named "component" in PowerShell
* There are not separate commands for creating `build` and `test` components.
